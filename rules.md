# Home of time rules (WIP)

## New people

Anyone on the server can invite new people to the server. However new people will join without any permissions to talk
in the lobby, and several other channels. They can become a *Member* by completing the following steps.

1. Be a guest on the server for at least 1 month.
2. Be nominated by an existing *Member* or *Admin*
3. A vote will be held in which all existing *Members* and *Admins* will get a vote.
4. If the vote passes they become a *Provisional Member*

## Provisional Members

These have the same permissions as *Members* however they are subject to have their membership revoked by a simple majority
vote that can be called at any time. This provisional period will last 2 months. By which time they will automatically become a full *Member*.

## Downgrading Members

*Members* can be downgraded to guest in the following fashion.

1. 2 or more members come to an *Admin* with complaints.
2. At the discretion of the *Admin* a vote can be held. With only *Admins* getting a vote.
3. If the vote passes, the *Member* is downgraded to guest.

## Bans

Bans are totally at the discretion of the admin that looks at the complaint. Permanent bans will require a vote between all *Admins*,
and require a unanimous result to permanent ban.

No temporary bans will last longer than 30 days.
